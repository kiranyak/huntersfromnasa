ABSTRACT:

Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) represent a major threat for agro-pastoral
resources and food security over almost 30 million km2
from northern Africa to the Arabian
peninsula and India. Given the differential food preferences of this insect pest and the extent
and remoteness of the their distribution area, near-real-time remotely-sensed information
on potential habitats support control operations by narrowing down field surveys to areas
favorable for their development and prone to gregarization and outbreaks. The development
of dynamic greenness maps, which detect the onset of photosynthetic vegetation, allowed
national control centers to identify potential habitats to survey, as locusts prefer green
and fresh vegetation. Their successful integration into the daily control operations led to
a new need: the near-real-time identification of the onset of dryness, a synonym for the
loss of habitat attractiveness, likely to be abandoned by locusts. The timely availability of
this information would enable control centers to focus their surveys on areas more prone
to gregarization, leading to more efficiency in the allocation of resources and in decision
making.

METHODS USED BY MODIS:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Decision Tree

OUR IDEA( Methods We used):
1. Neural Network (Backpropagation Algorithm): 
We propose to use previous data from MODIS and train them, and use the model for other untrained data ( and check with result). We kept factors like temperature, rainfall,soil moisture, vegetation, wind direction, etc as input and Green vs  Dry(Brown) coloring as output.
2. Principal Component Representation (Mapping Visualization)
We reduced above multidimensional or multifactor(temp, rainfall, etc ) plot into simple PCA plot.
